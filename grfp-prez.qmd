## Personal statement general outline

### **Personal, background, and goals** statement structure

::: notes
This must be writing to **advance fundamental knowledge**, nothing health-directed. Research focused on basic questions

We write to entertain. Academic writing is to entertain those who like scientific/nonfiction

The academic personal statement can be seen as a memoir

-   share a collection of memories linking **your person** to **science**

Connecting the audience to the writer through a message is key. The hook can be anyting, one of the best is eliciting a connection through a shared experience. Through emotion or senses

Continue the theme throughout for a cohesive article. Making it easy and pleasant to read.
:::

-   Intro

    -   Hook your audience (*e.g.* emotion, sensory)

-   Intellectual merit

    -   Awards, Fellowships, and research achievements

-   Broader Impacts

    -   Lab, University, and Community at large

-   Future Goals

    -   Conclude with your aspirations

# Research statement structure {auto-animate="true"}

::: {data-id="txt" style="font-size: 0.75em"}
> Present an original research topic that you would like to pursue in graduate school. Describe the research idea, the proposed approach, and resources needed to accomplish the research goal, including access to national facilities or collections, collaborations, overseas work, etc. You may cite references. Address the potential of the research to advance knowledge and understanding within science as well as the potential for broader impacts on society. The research must be in a field listed in the Solicitation (Section X, Fields of Study).

While some things you will include in your statements will require explanation, some others will not need added context.

fellowships like PREP and IMSD only need a reference i.e.

-   What challenges did you overcome to get here?

-   Honesty can find resonance with your readers.

-   However, you choose the story you want to present!

    -   Turn a set back or barrier into a hurdle you leapt
    -   Instead of overcoming adversity, create a theme of persistence
    -   Imply your passions without explicitly stating them

## [Concise writing starts with eliminating **passive voice**]{.small}

### Writing simply

::: notes
Awards are not passive but actively acquired!!!
:::

<br>

::: callout-tip
## Quick refresher on passive voice:

It's a be-verb (am, are, were, is, etc.) </br> + a past participle (-ed or -n verb):</br> **"The ball was thrown."**</br> Passive is not wrong or bad.</br> Use it as needed.</br> The other 99% of the time, use active voice:</br> **"I threw the ball."**</br> [[Be Verb](https://writing.rocks/be-verbs-microsoft-word/){target="_blank"}]{style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
:::

## [Cohesive **Themes** across a document make for good reading!]{.medsmall}

### Weaving Themes

::: notes
Consider the research statement -- Background Aim_Methods Aim_Results / scientific_domain Overall_Hypo

Lexical cohesion - This technique involves maintaining a consistent theme or topic throughout the text by using words and phrases related to that theme. It helps create a sense of unity and coherence in the writing, making it easier for the reader to follow and understand the message or story being conveyed.

This phrase refers to the famous literary passage written by Marcel Proust in his novel 'À la recherche du temps perdu' (In Search of Lost Time), in which he describes how the taste of a madeleine dipped in tea brings back a flood of childhood memories. It has since become a symbol for any sensory experience that triggers a deep sense of nostalgia or memory." style="--hover-width: 900px;"}

## Reference Letter Submission Deadline

Reference Letters Must be Submitted by October 11, 2024 (Friday) 5:00 p.m. EASTERN TIME

You must have at least 2 letters of recommendation, a maximum of 3. Consider finding \~2 backup letter writers.

## Review Criteria {.scrollable}

Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:

::: nonincremental
1.  What is the potential for the proposed activity to:

    a.  Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and

    b.  Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?

2.  To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?

3.  Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?

4.  How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?

5.  Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
:::

Additionally, Chapter II of the PAPPG states:

```         
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the US; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
```

Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria

```         
Applicants are reviewed on their demonstrated potential to advance knowledge and to make significant research achievements and contributions to their fields throughout their careers. Reviewers are asked to assess applications using a holistic, comprehensive approach, giving balanced consideration to all components of the application, including the educational and research record, leadership, outreach, service activities, and future plans, as well as individual competencies, experiences, and other attributes. The aim is to recruit and retain a diverse cohort of early-career individuals with high potential for future achievements, contributions, and broader impacts in STEM and STEM education.
